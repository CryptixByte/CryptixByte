### About Me 🏰 : 
Hello, I’m Marc S., also known as CryptixByte, Eclipsed Spirit. I am a proud graduate with an Associate’s degree in Cyber Security. Throughout my academic journey, my passion for computers grew immensely, and that drive continues to fuel my professional and personal pursuits. In my free time, I enjoy creating programs to challenge myself and work on innovative projects that contribute to my ongoing growth. I’ve participated in Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, refined my program GlyphLock into a complete Chrome extension, and am continuously developing new programs to expand my knowledge and skills further.

### Collaborations 🏹 :
- At this current point in time I have zero collaborations and work alone on projects, however, I would love to change that!

### Current Projects 🛠️ :
- Learning to mod Project Zomboid
- Building github.io page

### Project Updates & Announcements 📢 :
- Whispers of the Abyss & Iron Rune discontinued due to loss of files (old computer died)
- Looking for potential collaborators
- Planning on participating in CTF challenges & Bounties
